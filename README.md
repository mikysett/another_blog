# Hackers&Climbers: Small ideas on big rocks

!Work in progress!

## Tech side
This is the code source of a little blog I'm trying to make using NestJS, MongoDB and Vue.js.

Those 3 technologies are new to me, and I'm really interested on exploring them. I know it's not the best choice for a blog, still this project is a playground meant for me to experiment and mess around.

## Useful Resources

[Tutorial used to create this blog](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-blog-with-nest-js-mongodb-and-vue-js)
I discovered afterwards that the tutorial was made with Vue.js 2, to use v.3 you'll need to update the router part.
